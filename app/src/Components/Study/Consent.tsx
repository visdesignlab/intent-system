        You will complete a high-level task on an interactive scatterplot. As
        you complete the given task, the system suggests a list of intents, and
        you will select the intent that closely matches what you were trying to
        do. The goal is to measure how well the predicted intents match your
        own.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will see a training video which walks you through the system and how
        to use it to complete the tasks. You will go through 2 phases in the
        study. The phases are auto-complete supported selections and manual
        selections tasks for identifying patterns. The order is randomized. Each
        phase is preceded by training tasks. After all the tasks are completed,
        you will fill up a feedback form.

        The potential risks to participants are minimal. There may be minor risk
