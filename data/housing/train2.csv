Never mind that some of our favorite COLLECTIVE pals have lived here, but they've also put in the blood, sweat, and tears to make it feel like any cozy/cute/updated/perfect-for-having-the-homies-over casa should feel. Lucky buyers will be reaping the benefits of said work, and there's nothing like moving in and getting comfy without much effort. This one has loads of curb appeal, but the best part is, you're not actually perched right on the curb–a private walk leads to the front door, which is perfectly tucked back for a nice, secluded touch. That front yard? All garden, and all organic (think Oregon berries, pumpkins, peppers to melt your face)...which means more space in that ideally-sized back yard for, say, BBQing/wining/dining (on the brand new deck), raising chickens, and corn holing. Inside is a pleasant surprise, to say the least. A clean layout gives way to one bedroom downstairs and one, goodly loft-style room (with office area) upstairs. And we mustn't forget that little top-window nook; it's screaming for a cozy bunch of pillows to create the perfect reading spot (mind the gap). The current (awesome) owners took it upon themselves to give the kitchen a full-blown facelift, and it was a well-advised effort. Wood on the wall was sourced from a dilapidated cabin in Utah, and the metal backsplash was brilliantly constructed from a mining car in the same, rural town (repurposed antiquities aside, this cookery turned out sleek and modern as hell). If you're looking for a charmer of a home on a charmer of a street, then this is your 'hood...and this is definitely your house.

This stellar spot has just cropped up but a mere stone's throw from our South Temple HQ, and we're thrilled to death to be repping such a beautiful space on such a near-and-dear street (really, it's the best). When it comes to this particular salty slice, we'll start from the curb, 'cause she's got appeal in spades. This craftsman-style casa in sporting a pretty impressive bay window that looks out onto a beautifully-landscaped front yard (think: people-watching over Parcheesi in the fall, street-side snowmen come winter). Inside, you'll find a spacious and well-kept interior that bears phenomenal natural light year round. Outfitted with some vintage-inspired touches (specifically those delish French doors to the formal dining room, the stained glass peppered throughout, and the full walk-in pantry), this betty has just enough updates to make the lives lived within nice 'n' easy. Newer appliances, some slick hardwood floors, and a finished basement (translation: the rough stuff is taken care of, and all that's left to do is settle in and make the space yours). Out back you'll find a sensationally private patio (the previous owners considered putting in pool–we wholeheartedly second that notion), as well as a few off-street, covered parking spots–they'll be fab come cooler temps). Call us biased, but we happen to think this is one of the greatest streets in the ol' US of A. Won't you be our neighbor?

Completely renovated and updated in 2004 by the owner-architect, the home delivers oversized rooms and contemporary features within the architectural style of the period. Artfully designed, the timeless materials and the meticulous craftsmanship is extraordinary and unique. The outstanding attention to detail is evident throughout. An artist's studio (or future guest house) was built on the .70 acre property at the time of renovation with a linear lap pool built in between. Framed by mature trees and a beautifully designed gardens and landscape, the view from every set of French doors (all five of them) presents a balanced, serene picture and invites the outdoors in. The floor plan is well designed and functional with a modern feeling. The living room opens into a family room with custom cabinetry and wet bar – ideal for entertaining. The professionally designed kitchen offers a sophisticated entertaining venue as well as a cozy dining area with a fireplace. A well-appointed formal dining room sits between the two and if the walls could talk, they would tell stories of spectacular dinner parties, celebrations and memorable events. The large master bedroom is a tranquil and sophisticated retreat. Two more bedrooms (one being used as a den currently) are on the same level as well as an additional full bath and laundry. Downstairs, there is an exercise room, large laundry/craft room, workshop, storage and flexible space. The artist's studio is fully equipped with a kitchen, bath and laundry. There is garage space for three cars plus exceptional storage. State of the art plumbing, electrical and smart system technology and integrated speakers and museum quality lighting are found throughout this prestigious residence. The lifestyle is classic Salt Lake City with skiing, tennis, biking, hiking, golf, country clubs and the many outdoor activities this area is known for, within a short drive away. Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only. Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement.","Metal; Wood Shake Shingles","No","Salt Lake","Wasatch","Bryant","West","","Rowland Hall-St Mark's","Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Connected","Call Agent/Appt","0.0","18727","","69433","500","11/12/2015","3200000","Conventional","0","11/17/2015","UT","Sold","WAY","MILITARY","2-Story","0","FEDERAL HEIGHTS","09-33-377-003","13128","Cash; Conventional","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","5.00","2","1","2","2","6","1","2","3","0","1","6,118","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Draperies; Full","00/00/0000","1931","84103","RES","11/17/2015"

Painted wood work was stripped and restored on the original cabinetry, hardware and fixtures were chosen for authenticity, and in the downstairs bunk and bathroom additions touches like subway and hex tile were used to seamlessly integrate with the original structure. Throughout, there is a fluidity between these era specific finishes and the incorporation of modern conveniences like central air, contemporary appliances, and a two car garage. While the photos will capture this aesthetic, touring the property in person reveals depth in these details.  The property's immediate setting is a treelined street nestled at the edge of the Marmalade District, with restaurants and shops just around the corner. Geographically, you have the broader convenience of a location less than ten minutes from Salt Lake's International airport, six blocks from downtown shopping, and an appropriate four blocks to freeway access.","Asphalt Shingles","No","","","","","","","Power: Connected; Water: Connected","Agent Has Key","0.0","88253","","70034","","09/18/2015","334000","Conventional","0","09/18/2015","UT","Sold","","600","Bungalow/Cottage","0","MARMALADE","08-36-202-026","1409","Cash; Conventional; FHA; VA","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","2.00","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1,754","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Draperies","00/00/0000","1917","84103","","09/18/2015"

Soon thereafter, in 1878, this resplendently-historic homestead was built. Tucked into the be-fruited streets of Marmalade, this majestic casa is beautiful, private, and most certainly a taste of the ""good ol' days"". Though the bones be old, make no mistake–this is a sturdy build. There are plenty of original, historic details throughout the space, and all of the new work/upgrades have been completed using period-appropriate materials and design (including an amaze O'Keefe Merritt range in the kitchen, and sublime vintage tiles in the bathroom). High ceilings, large, natural-light-givin' windows, and six (6!) original fireplaces make this spot equal parts ""venerable vintage"" and ""breezy retreat"". Originally built as a three-room structure, it was expanded in Eastlake style to include a formal dining room, butler's pantry (fancy), kitchen, and an additional three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Also included: two laundry rooms (one up, one down) and a steam shower in the upstairs bath. The downstairs bathroom is plumbed and wired, ready to install whichever ornate, clawfooted tub you choose, and the owners have historically-accurate floor tile ready and waiting to be laid down and made rad (also ready for your touches: professionally-drawn design plans for sink and full shower). The backyard is a lush, fruitful, and utterly private paradise (think: The Secret Garden). The large rock wall keeps hidden a new custom-build shed, a few mature trees (including pear, peach, cherry, apple, and plum for goods long into the fall), a couple of raised veggie garden beds (with automated full watering system), and a cute as all get-out two-story stone playhouse. The possibilities are endless with this sweet old space. For lovers of SLC's past, present, and bright future: this is the place.  Plumbed, but unfinished bathroom in basement. Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only.  Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement.","Wood Shake Shingles","No","Salt Lake","Washington","Bryant","West","","","Gas: Available; Gas: Connected; Power: Available; Power: Connected; Sewer: Available; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Available; Water: Connected","Appt/Use Key Box","0.0","57065","","55467","13050","10/01/2015","435000","Conventional","0","10/08/2015","UT","Sold","","200","Rambler/Ranch","0","MARMALADE","08-36-202-010","2449","Cash; Conventional; FHA; VA","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","5","2.00","2","0","0","1","6","1","1","2","0","0","3,317","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","00/00/0000","1878","84103","R-2","10/08/2015"
