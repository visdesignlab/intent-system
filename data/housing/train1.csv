I'll bet you a nickel you won't find a nicer, more updated unit in the price range anywhere near downtown! Small storage closet, covered 1 space parking, elevator. Pet friendly.  Virtually everything in this unit is new. Vacant, staged-text for KB location.

This is one of the earliest remaining homes in the Salt Lake Valley and Utah.The wood floors are original to 1868 and it's on the National Register of Historic Places as a 'contributing structure'. The exterior can be modified and remodeled as the register does not mean to encumber home owners. Picture this: 1705 sq. ft street level, where there's 1/2 as a walk out 2 BR apartment and 1/2 as storage and a workshop accessible from the home on the second floor. Main home is also a street level entrance because it's on a hill and has three bedrooms and three baths in two floors. The garage level apartment is off the main patio of the home.  Built for John Alford, a British native, convert and polygamist who migrated here in 1865. He spent his career working in the dry goods department of ZCMI. The home has had alterations and additions but it's not a crazy puzzle of bad design but instead a wonderfully restored and updated home with original woods, views like crazy of the valley and our sunsets, and rarest of all...a two car garage and a carport! There are two matching parlors in the front, each with a fireplace. Identical rooms, one for each wife. One room now is a living room and the other is a dining room off the kitchen-with an original chandelier from the lobby of the old Center Theater downtown.  The upstairs bedrooms are identical and huge and built with a nursery room off of each one which could be used as closets, dens or yoga rooms. The bath is new and a gorgeous walk-in shower. This is a legal, non-conforming triplex and has a business license. Each unit has it's own laundry. The owners lived here and made sure their rentals were in compliance with the city. There is an apartment above the garage (the 'loft unit' @588 sq. ft) and is paying $650 a month. The basement ('garden unit' 855 sq ft of that area) pays $800 for 2 BR's.

The rooms are large and open and because you're on a high hill, the views from the two level deck are 360 of the valley and the mountains. The downstairs rec room has high ceilings and the laundry area is large enough for more storage and side by side machines.  The landscaping is low water and there's lots of room in the garage to store your yard tools or recreational toys.

Wonderful Arts and Crafts era bungalow of a pattern-book designed home with a fully finished basement with a walkout entry/exit. Can be used as a mother in law apartment or just more living space with good ceiling height. The original woodwork in the home is stunning and the original design was for easy flow of living, sleeping, cooking and dining. This home is an entertainers dream because the kitchen is large with plenty of counter space and island prep area and the dining room could easily seat a formal party of 12. Let them flow out to the beautiful back yard or sit and chat on the front porch that is the entire front face of the home. The neighbors are terrific and as this is a one-way street it's a bit quieter than other areas of the Avenues/Federal Heights area. Parking is easily available on the street or off-street via alley access to a two car pad in the back. Everyone who comes to visit always says 'It's so much bigger inside than it looks on the street'!  Come discover! The history is that it was built for Clarissa Leigh, a widow of Clionton Leigh who was a newspaperman killed in 1907 in a train accident at Bingham Canyon while covering a story. He was a legislative reporter at the time of his death. Clarissa then rented the home and then sold it to a doctor named Harry Welch. He then sold it to a life insurance salesman. These current owners are downsizing to a condo so this can now be your legacy home!","Asphalt Shingles","No","Salt Lake","Wasatch","Bryant","West","McGillis School","Judge Memorial","Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Connected","Call Agent/Appt","0.0","74602","","70011","6695","06/13/2016","515000","Conventional","0","06/14/2016","UT","Sold","ST","U","Bungalow/Cottage","0","AVENUES","09-32-478-012","1606","Cash; Conventional; FHA; VA","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","3.00","2","0","1","1","1","1","2","2","0","0","2,775","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Part","00/00/0000","1908","84103","","06/14/2016"

Currently rented but tenants will vacate in June. This is not a busy street so you're missing out on a really amazing home.  All the original hardwood tiger striped wood mantles around two fireplaces, imported 1800's tile around another fireplace, pocket doors and floors and moulding were all kept. The huge kitchen was updated and probably a dozen people could stand and knosh in the room itself! You could line up 10 tiny homes in the back yard and still have parking for 10 cars or a giant garage, workshop and studio and still have room for chicken coops and gardens on this long and deep undeveloped rear yard.  This home looks small from the street but has an amazing amount of room on the main and upstairs floors. Brand new central air, too.  The original owner was Joshua Whitney, son of Horace Kimball and Mary Whitney. Joshua married Emmeline World and they had 6 kids. He worked for the Deseret News for 40 years but prior to that he ws with the Salt Lake Stock and Mining Exchange.

What is textured modern? Think Scandinavian design sensibility mixed with soft and cozy embellishments in just the right places. This is a once in a generation opportunity to purchase a true masterpiece, featuring - hands down - the best views of the entire valley that must be experienced to understand. A meticulous one-year renovation completed by Icon Homes using only the highest quality building products and finishes available - gorgeous coulson cedar exterior siding, Marvin Integrity Windows, Mirabelle sinks and so much more. Enjoy completely unobstructed views from your living room through the modern quad sliding door. We can't say enough about this gorgeous living space. Modern, but warm. Clean, but with various textures. This home boasts 4 bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms and a 3 car garage. All bedrooms have their own ensuite bathroom so that you can enjoy the decadent master suite in peace and quiet. The master wing includes a private deck off the bedroom, separate shower and soaker tub, custom walnut cabinetry, quartz countertops and Walker Zanger tile. The large master closet is already built out for you and links through a pocket door to the 'Lady Lair - a private sanctuary that could become a study, office or meditation/yoga room. The kitchen features Thermofoil cabinetry, Thermador appliances, a custom hood vent by a local artisan and a fantastic wrapped island that maximizes the views while you chat around breakfast or while cooking for friends. The guest bedroom sits on the opposite side of the main floor and includes a large full bath that can be easily used as a second powder room. The powder room, large pantry with built in cabinetry, and mudroom are all easily accessible from the garage and main entrance, making the transition from the outside world to your sanctuary seamless. A huge family room can be found in the lower level with views every step of the way. An adjacent secondary living space is perfect for a home theater, hobby or game room. 2 bedrooms with their own en suites are right off the family room. Past the family room is the Man Cave, featuring its own separate entrance to the outside to make working on your bike, board or hobby a breeze. The views continue as you go out to the outdoor living area, built for enjoying the long summer nights with a tongue and groove cedar ceiling, limestone wall with built-in gas fireplace and a ceiling fan. The 2 zone sprinkler system and fully sodded yard also includes a gas line for your future fire pit. Beauty attracts the eye, but personality captures the heart.

Breathe. Relax. Just far enough out of downtown Salt Lake - sitting at the top of the upper Avenues - the only sounds you'll hear are rustling tree leaves and song birds. Breathe in the finest air coming out of the canyons above you - blanketed in the most amazing, unobstructed valley and mountain views that are such a rare find. Come in and relax because we have even more to offer inside. Upon entry you'll be captivated by the valley view from all angles - open living, dining, kitchen concept flows so meticulously here, walking through the rest of the house will seem unnecessary. Kitchen is home to all custom cabinets, Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Thermador appliances, wine fridge and dual dishwasher for superb entertaining. Soaring every height with proportionate room sizes adorn the sleeping rooms on the main - en suite bath and, again, the views. Saunter upstairs to the master suite quarters - oh-so dreamy, quiet, and as if you were sitting on top of the world looking at it from a bird's view. Here's what else it has: wall fireplace to warm you on winter nights, laundry perfectly placed outside the master closet, and the bath is spa-worthy on its own - free-standing tub, steam shower, double sinks, and of course, the view. Adjacent to the master is an office, or gym space if you prefer. Now that you have visited all that's on the main floor, take a peek downstairs: with this space all above-ground and 3 walk out options, you can't go wrong. 4 large bedrooms, 3 large baths, laundry, study space, fireplace and a game/family room area, too. Storage? Of course. And yes, it all comes with ""the view"". The lot totals almost an acre, fenced to keep pets in, a patio area for dining and guests, a gas fire pit, a small (removable) green house, and just enough yard and garden beds to play in. If impeccable care, top-end building quality, and views for time and all eternity are on your ""must have"" list, give us a call and come experience it for yourself.","Asphalt Shingles","No","Salt Lake","Ensign","Bryant","West","","","Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Connected","Call Agent/Appt","0.0","82920","","68816","","07/01/2016","1700000","Conventional","0","07/05/2016","UT","Sold","RD","EDGEHILL","2-Story","0","NORTHCREST","09-29-327-007","11221","Cash; Conventional","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","7","6.00","2","0","4","2","3","0","0","2","0","1","6,009","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Blinds; Part; Shades","00/00/0000","1968","84103","","07/05/2016"

No, seriously. This one is right around the corner from our COLLECTIVE HQ, and we can attest to the joy of living/working in the Avenues. It's a top-floor unit, and there's little to want for here. Imagine taking your morning walk down tree-lined streets to grab a cup of coffee (at the new Publik, perhaps?) and take in the lovely homes around you. Care to walk a bit further, come summer, and you'll find yourself right downtown. Sure, this unit is absolutely affordable, but it's also just as cute as a button. A light-filled interior with gorgeous hardwood floors and plenty of room for the occasional dinner party or movie night. And you're looking squarely at two sets of sliders to that top-floor balcony...which basically means that you can open half the wall and enjoy that cool, spring breeze (you don't see that too often in a condo, friends). Bonus: even though walkability is here in spades, you've still got two dedicated parking stalls. #winwin This here is Aves living with a few added perks. Don't miss out.

Tall ceilings throughout the main level give it a feeling of openness. You can slow down time relaxing on the front city-view porch, the downstairs patio, the covered backyard patio, or the charming original sleeping porch. Come back to the present with the newly remodeled kitchen including granite countertops, new appliances and a separate dining area. Friends won't track in mud after playing at the park across the street (Lindsay Gardens) because they'll leave their shoes in the mud room. A mother-in-law apartment with walk-out basement gives your guests (and you!) a little privacy. Plenty of built ins for storage, not to mention the multitude of closets and large laundry/storage room means there's plenty of space to stow your stuff.

The new Marmalade Library, all things downtown (shopping, eating, drinking, etc.), and a smattering of Marmalade, one-off spots are all perfectly walkable. Covered, off-street parking...check.

But these days–what with the stellar new public library and more interesting development on the way–the sugar coating on this 'hood is all but irresistible (think: kid in candy store). That all said, even if this townhouse were located in the middle of nowhere, we'd probably still be big fans. There's the perfect modern layout, for starters: open kitchen/dining/living space, private patio on the second level, and two upstairs bedrooms (each with its own bathroom, mind you). There's also the attached two-car garage (always a bonus), and the fact that the building–and everything from appliances to fixtures–is only two years old. Oh, and then there's the fact that the roof is covered in solar panels. Yes, yes. For the last year, this unit's highest monthly power bill was $60 (the lowest was $10...and the average was just $30, people). Who says being green doesn't make financial sense? HOA fees here are next-to-nuthin (a mere $100 bucks a month). Come have a look-see...we think you're unlikely to pass on this treat.

And with that unbroken string of lovely older abodes, the block between S and T might just be her best block. And right smack dab in the middle of said block, there is a jewel of a space that might just be the best of the bunch. As far as the curb's concerned, we've already honed you in to one of the cutest casas of them all, and her appeal extends every bit as much to the inside, too. It's all here: a beautiful (and original) front door, rich hardwood floors, an antique fireplace and mantle, dramatic stairway with wood railing and balusters (ideal for the making of grand entrances), and crazy-charming stained glass. But an antiquated timepiece this spot is not. With an open living/dining area adjacent to the (spacious) kitchen, and a few grown-up sized bedrooms upstairs (including a stellar main suite), the layout of this place makes total sense for 21st century fams. Throw in a goodly-sized yard, a newer two-car garage, and a brand new roof (all of which are about as common as wine in the grocery store, 'round these parts), and we're pretty certain this teal beauty will nab your heart just as quickly as she stole ours.

Our little city isn't so little anymore, and so many of our cutest salty spaces are getting snapped up quicker than a Cabbage Patch Doll circa 1983. Our advice to any and all folks looking to invest in our fantastically-bright future: do it. The fact of the matter is, we've got loads of amazing spaces that just need a touch of TLC to be phenomenal investment properties, and we say it's best to get in while the getting is good. Case in point: this sweet little setup in the Avenues. As far as diverse and damn-cute 'hoods go, you'd be hard-pressed to find one that checks off more boxes on your list than the Aves. Local eats? Check. Walkable? These sidewalks practically wrote the book. This particularly pretty little Victorian is showcasing some of that aforementioned diversity in the way of sweetly-scalloped trim and an insanely cute front porch (topped with its own very own little turret, this baby is prime for stoopin'). The OG charm is here in spades (exposed brick bits, sensational fireplace), but after a complete remodel, this casa is boasting updated baths (note: plural) and kitchen, as well as newer AC and furnace. Those hardwood floors are dreamy to say the least, and the open layout is punctuated by a pretty pair of French doors. There's loads of space both inside and out, and we think all it needs is a touch of love to make it something truly sensational. This is a quintessentially-cute space in a 'hood that's as good as they come. You can have it all, and it's all right here. Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only.  Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement. Information deemed reliable but not guaranteed. Buyer and buyer's agent to verify all information.

Based on feedback we've just lowered the price $10K to make it an even better deal!  Think condo with a yard and no HOA fees as this is so easy on the budget and the sellers's aren't greed-open to offers!  OPEN SAT Jan 30 1-3 rain or snow.  Nest in this very special, wondrous, cozy, Avenues home first owned by a Mormon convert from England at the turn of the last century.  Let's be honest up front: 1) parking is only on the street, 2) the master bedroom is the whole second floor and big enough for a full sized mattress. It's more like a loft where you snuggle in to sleep or read or...mmmm!  If you're still interested, then here's why I would live here in a heart beat: updated mechanicals; terrific cooks kitchen big enough for 4 stools so you can knosh and cook with friends; wet bar on the back porch with a concrete top that's bigger than all the counter space in the kitchen and where I'd be mixing cocktails for all  my summer parties; back yard is large enough for gardeners and small enough for non-gardeners with a hot tub; main floor laundry; main floor study or guest bedroom; and tasteful, updated decor inside.
